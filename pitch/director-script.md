# Director's script: live pitch (3:00)

The stage script, scene by scene. Each scene says **who speaks, the exact words, what the hands do and what the screen shows**. Learn your own lines word for word; know everyone else's cues. Setup, backups and Q&A: [live-pitch.md](live-pitch.md).

Why this version (2026-10-31): in the real supermarket test the verifier took **about one minute** per photo (not 12-15 s). Part of that is waiting for the verifier's fee to be confirmed on Cardano before it answers (`codigo/docs/verified.md`, M1 row). So: **one live photo only**, and the team explains the system while the verifier works. The cheat is shown as a screenshot from the morning test, not live (a second live check would cost another minute).

Open proposal (2026-10-31, Fernando, pending Lorenz and Isabel): a fictional, told-only opening ("Lena") with the agency context and no Shelfie price on stage. It replaces scenes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 if adopted; see [Proposal: fictional opening](#proposal-fictional-opening-lena) at the end. Until then the scenes below stand.

## Cast

| Who | Role on stage | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| **Isabel** | The person in the store; opens and closes | Phone (web app logged in), printed price tag |
| **Lorenz** | Explains product, verifier, price | Nothing; stands next to the screen |
| **Fernando** | Drives the laptop and talks money and Cardano | Laptop keyboard |
| **Helmut** | Timekeeper (phone timer), backup | Backup phone, USB stick with the recordings |

## Laptop tabs (Fernando)

| Key | Tab |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+1` | Story page, one key press down ("real request" beat), page clicked once for focus |
| `Ctrl+2` | Sokosumi: the job opened before the pitch, lock tx visible |
| `Ctrl+3` | Dashboard: job page with the verdict rows and payout row |
| `Ctrl+4` | preprod.cardanoscan.io: Isabel's payout address |
| `Ctrl+5` | Screenshot of the red verdict from the morning test (cheat) |

On the story page: Page Down (or the clicker) moves exactly one beat or section; `End` jumps to the close.

## Props checklist (Helmut, 10 minutes before)

- [ ] Fresh job created and open for claims; Isabel's phone shows it in the list.
- [ ] Printed price tag of the job's product in Isabel's hand.
- [ ] Red-verdict screenshot of the cheat (morning test) in tab 5.
- [ ] Recording of a full green run (morning test) on the USB stick and the backup phone.
- [ ] W-VBUY (verifier fees) and W-PAY (payouts) funded (Fernando, `fund-check`).
- [ ] Timer ready; the four of us know the stretch lines in scene 5.

## Scene 1: The request (0:00-0:25)

**Screen:** story page, "It started with a real request".

**ISABEL** (to the jury, no "Hello, we are..."):
> "A friend of my father wants to bring a new drink to Germany. He asked me: can you check the competition in a few shops? What does it cost, and is it really on the shelf? He lives abroad. He can't check my photos. And no AI can walk into a supermarket."

**FERNANDO:** on "no AI can walk", one key: "An agent that hires a person to look."

## Scene 2: The idea (0:25-0:40)

**LORENZ:**
> "So we built Shelfie. A person takes the photo, a second agent checks it, and the money moves only if the photo is true."

**FERNANDO:** on "the money moves", one key: "Nobody pays for a photo that isn't true."

**LORENZ:**
> "Shelfie. Paid only when the photo is true."

## Scene 3: The job (0:40-0:55)

**FERNANDO:** one key (How it works), then `Ctrl+2` (Sokosumi).
> "His request as a job on Sokosumi: one product, one store in Munich. The fee is locked in escrow on Cardano. This lock is from before the pitch, because escrow takes half an hour."

**FERNANDO:** `Ctrl+3` (dashboard job page).

## Scene 4: The photo (0:55-1:10)

**ISABEL** (phone in one hand, tag in the other; she talks while she acts):
> "I'm the person in the store. I take the job."

*Taps Claim. Taps Open camera. The hand sign appears.*

> "Only now, when the camera opens, the app gives me a hand sign. Here: [reads the real sign, e.g. 'three fingers, left of the tag']."

*Shows the phone screen to the jury for one second. Holds the fingers next to the tag, both in frame. Shoots.*

> "Sent."

Notes: she has 90 seconds from the camera opening. The engine accepts a photo only 5 s after the claim; her lines cover that.

## Scene 5: While the verifier works (1:10 to green, planned 60 s)

The phone and the dashboard show "checking". Nobody looks at the phone in silence: the three blocks below run in this order.

**W1, LORENZ** (about 25 s; screen: dashboard):
> "Now the verifier works. It is a separate agent, and our engine pays it for every single check, over x402 on Cardano. A vision model reads the photo, but fixed rules decide. Is the hand sign right? Is it the right product? Can it read a price? Is it inside the time window? And is it not a photo of a screen?"

**W2, FERNANDO** (about 20 s; `Ctrl+1`, one key: "Already running"):
> "Every step of this is a public transaction on Cardano's test network: the escrow lock, the verifier's fee, the payout to the worker, and at the end the settlement, or the refund. These five are from our earlier test runs."

**W3, LORENZ** (about 15 s; `Ctrl+5`, red-verdict screenshot):
> "And if someone cheats? This morning we photographed an old photo of the same shelf. No hand sign, so: red. No money moved. An old photo can't show a sign that didn't exist yet."

**FERNANDO:** `Ctrl+3` (dashboard) after W3.

**Stretch lines**, only if it is still checking, in this order, one at a time:
- **S1, LORENZ:** "Every job gets a new sign, and the person has ninety seconds. So you can't prepare the photo in advance."
- **S2, FERNANDO:** "If no photo passes before the deadline, the result is withheld, and the brand gets the escrow back automatically."
- **S3, LORENZ:** "Today we run the verifier ourselves. An independent verifier is just another web address."
- **S4, ISABEL:** "For our friend, this is exactly the step he couldn't do from abroad."

**Rule for the green moment:** whoever is speaking finishes the sentence, then Isabel takes over (scene 6). Do not cut anyone mid-word.

## Scene 6: Green and paid (about 2:10-2:25)

**ISABEL** (raises the phone to the jury):
> "Green. It read the price: [reads the price on the card]."

**FERNANDO** (dashboard payout row, then `Ctrl+4` explorer, refresh once):
> "And I'm paid out. This is the payout transaction, here on the Cardano explorer."

If the explorer has not caught up: "The explorer catches up in a few seconds; here is the hash in the app." Stay on the dashboard.

## Scene 7: Price and honest limits (about 2:25-2:48)

**FERNANDO:** `Ctrl+1`, one key ("What one shelf check costs today").

**LORENZ:**
> "A test purchase through an agency starts at fifty euros. A Shelfie check: about twelve, and only if the photo passes. To be honest: this is the test network and one real request, and the sign proves the photo is new, not the shop. Store QR codes are next."

## Scene 8: Close (about 2:48-3:00)

**FERNANDO:** `End` ("Ready when you are").

**ISABEL:**
> "Next time, our friend doesn't call us. He posts a job. And nobody pays for a photo that isn't true."

## Time rules (Helmut watches the timer)

| Situation | What we do |
|---|---|
| Verifier green before 2:00 | Skip the stretch lines; at scene 7 Lorenz may add first: "Market research is a hundred-and-fifty-billion-dollar business, built for big budgets." |
| Still checking at 2:15 | Stretch lines S1-S4 |
| Green after 2:20 | Scene 7: Lorenz says only the price sentence, drops "To be honest..." (answer it in Q&A) |
| Still nothing at 2:35, or red / error | **LORENZ:** "The live check is still running; here is the same check from this morning." Helmut plays the green-run recording on the backup phone, Fernando shows its payout tx. Then scene 8. Never present the recording as live |

Helmut's time marks: 0:25, 0:40, 0:55, 1:10, (green), 2:25, 2:48, 3:00.

## Word count

About 385 spoken words without stretch lines. W1-W3 (about 145 words) run during the 60 s wait; the rest (about 240 words) takes about 1:50 at 130 words per minute. With the claim, the shot and the tab switches the pitch lands at about 2:55-3:00 with a 60 s verifier. Faster verifier: it ends earlier; slower: the stretch lines take the time and the time rules cut scene 7.

## Rehearsal plan

1. **Read-through** (seated, 10 min): everyone reads their lines aloud once, Helmut times.
2. **Walk-through with the screen** (15 min): Fernando does every key press and tab switch; the phone only pretends.
3. **Full run with a real job** (15 min each, twice): real claim, real photo, real verifier; note the verifier time each run.
4. **Failure drill** (5 min): Helmut calls "red" or "stuck" at 2:35; the team switches to the recording.

## Proposal: fictional opening (Lena)

Status: proposal, 2026-10-31 (Fernando). Lorenz (pitch owner) and Isabel decide; if adopted, the scenes below replace the matching scenes above and `pitch-plan.md` section 2 follows.

Why:
- No consent question: the real request is not told on stage.
- The pitch opens with a person and a concrete question, then the agency context makes it a market, not one anecdote (Taikai pitch structure: intro, problem with impact, product, demo, wrap-up).
- The argument is "pay only for what is true", not "cheaper": no Shelfie price on stage, because EUR 12 is illustrative (`slides/facts.tex`). The EUR 50+ agency visit and the $6B stay; both are sourced in `facts.tex`.

Rules for the story:
- Told only. No picture of Lena, no fictional brand, logo or can on screen: the live demo photographs a real, well-known drink, so Lena's own brand never appears. The real drink is "the market leader", her competitor, and is not named in the spoken lines.
- The wording signals fiction ("Picture...", "let's call her"). Never present Lena as a customer, pilot or interview.
- No "days of waiting" or "minutes" claims: neither is measured or sourced.

Timing: scenes 1 and 2 grow from 0:40 to 0:45; scene 7 loses the price sentence, so the total stays at about 3:00.

### Scene 1: Lena and the agency (0:00-0:35)

**Screen:** story page, a text-only beat (proposed: "What does it cost? Is it on the shelf?"). The current "It started with a real request" beat and its photo go; `/story` change is an open item for Lorenz.

**ISABEL** (0:00-0:20, to the jury, no "Hello, we are..."):
> "Picture a small drinks maker in Lisbon. Let's call her Lena. She has a new energy drink and wants to launch it in Munich. One question decides her price: what does the market leader cost here, and is it really on the shelf? She's two thousand kilometres away."

**FERNANDO:** one key (proposed beat: "EUR 50+ per visit. Paid anyway.").

**LORENZ** (0:20-0:35):
> "Today, Lena has one option: hire an agency. A single store visit starts at fifty euros, and she pays whether the photo is usable or not. Brands spend six billion dollars a year on in-store work like this."

### Scene 2: The idea (0:35-0:45)

**ISABEL:**
> "And her AI can't walk into a supermarket."

**FERNANDO:** one key: "An agent that hires a person to look."

**LORENZ:**
> "So we built Shelfie. An agent hires someone nearby, a second agent checks the photo, and Lena pays only for a photo that is true. Shelfie: paid only when the photo is true."

### Before the pitch: Lena's order (Helmut, Fernando)

Why: from "Place order" in `/b` to the task on the worker's phone takes about 2:30-3:05 on the real hub (2:30 and 2:45 at 03:50, 3:04 for the first DELIVER at 04:10; `docs/ai-log.md`, `codigo/docs/verified.md`), almost all of it the Sokosumi buyer's escrow lock; our part, lock to open task, is under 5 s. An order placed at 0:00 would show up at about 2:30-3:05, after the claim in scene 4 (about 0:58). So the order is placed before the pitch.

| When | What | Who |
|---|---|---|
| T-8 to T-6 min (previous team still presenting) | Place Lena's order in `/b`: one store, the demo drink | Fernando |
| About 3 min later | Confirm the task is in the list on Isabel's phone. Do **not** claim it: the claim timer (`CLAIM_TTL_SEC=180`) starts at the claim | Isabel |
| 2-3 min after the first order | Backup order, same store and product, in case the first never appears | Fernando |
| Until the table is called | Watch the clock: the job stays open `JOB_WINDOW_SEC=660` (11 min from job creation), so the order covers a start delay of about 4-6 min. Longer delay: place a fresh order | Helmut |

Values from the hub handoff (`docs/ai-log.md`, 03:10); confirm them with Helmut or `/api/health` before the pitch. The unused order ends in withhold and automatic refund: keep it as refund evidence, never present it as part of the live demo. Do not place a new order on stage: it adds nothing and costs credits.

### Scene 3: The job (0:45-0:58)

**FERNANDO:** one key (How it works), then `/b` tab (Lena's order: status, credits locked, escrow lock tx), then `Ctrl+2` (Sokosumi) only if time allows.
> "Lena placed this order a few minutes ago. Before anyone works, her money is locked in escrow on Cardano; that lock is what you see here. Now the job is open for anyone in Munich."

If a judge asks why the order was placed earlier: "The escrow lock is a real Cardano transaction sent by Sokosumi; it takes about two to three minutes to confirm. Our part, from lock to open task, takes under five seconds."

**FERNANDO:** `Ctrl+3` (dashboard job page).

### Scene 4: The photo (0:58-1:12)

**ISABEL** (phone in one hand, tag in the other):
> "I'm the person in the store. This is Lena's competitor. I take the job."

Rest of scene 4 unchanged (claim, hand sign, shot, "Sent."). Scene 5 unchanged, except stretch line S4:
- **S4, ISABEL:** "For Lena, this is exactly the step she couldn't do from Lisbon."

### Scene 7: What Lena pays for, and honest limits (about 2:25-2:48)

**FERNANDO:** `Ctrl+1`, one key (proposed beat: "Paid only when true" instead of "What one shelf check costs today").

**LORENZ:**
> "Lena never pays for a blurry photo or the wrong shelf. If no photo passes, the escrow goes back to her. To be honest: this is the test network, and the sign proves the photo is new, not the shop. Store QR codes are next."

If green came before 2:00, Lorenz may add first: "Out-of-stocks cost retail about a trillion dollars a year." (sourced `\MarketPain`; replaces the unsourced "hundred-and-fifty-billion" line in the time rules).

If asked for the price: answer from `qa-prep.md` Q15a, not on stage.

### Scene 8: Close (about 2:48-3:00)

**FERNANDO:** `End` ("Ready when you are"); the team names and roles are on this screen.

**ISABEL:**
> "Lena doesn't need a trip to Munich. She posts a job. And nobody pays for a photo that isn't true."

### Follow-ups if adopted

| What | Owner |
|---|---|
| `/story`: drop the "real request" beat and photo, add the text-only question beat and the "EUR 50+ per visit. Paid anyway." beat; replace the price beat with "Paid only when true"; names on the close | Lorenz |
| `pitch-plan.md` section 2 (hook), `live-pitch.md` roles line, `storyline.md`, `video-script.md`: same story | Lorenz |
| `slides/facts.tex`: `\RequestWho`, `\RequestLine` and `\PricePerStore` no longer used on stage (backup deck only) | Lorenz |
| Confirm the demo drink is in the seeded catalog (ADR-17) | Isabel |
| Props checklist and laptop tabs above: replace "Fresh job created" with the order timing in "Before the pitch: Lena's order"; add a `/b` tab with Lena's order before `Ctrl+2` | Lorenz |
| Add the "why was the order placed earlier" answer to `qa-prep.md` | Lorenz |
