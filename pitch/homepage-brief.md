# Homepage brief (pitch screen)

Decision (team, 2026-10-30 evening): the live pitch uses our homepage instead of the Beamer deck. The homepage explains the vision and is **scrolled only, never clicked** during the pitch. Style reference: [omarchy.org](https://omarchy.org): one long page, big hero, then short sections (heading, one or two sentences, a few cards).

The UI team builds it; this file is the content brief from the pitch side (C, Lorenz). Where it lives, stack and look are the builders' call (look: `../diseno/ui-design.md` tokens if they fit). The deck in `slides/` stays as the offline backup.

## Rules for the page

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Scroll only: no tabs, accordions, carousels, hover-only content, modals, or "read more" | Nobody clicks on stage; what is hidden is not seen |
| Pitch sections 1-6 below are each one full screen (`100vh`), in this order; one Page Down / Space lands exactly on the next one (e.g. `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` or anchors) | Fernando scrolls with one key per beat, no fine scrolling |
| Readable from the back row on a projector at 1920x1080, browser zoom 125%: heading at most 6 words, body at most 2 short sentences per section | Judges glance, they do not read |
| No autoplay video, no animation that must finish before the content is visible, no sound | Timing is tight (2:45 of 3:00) |
| Static and offline-capable: all images and fonts local, no live API calls to engine, verifier or explorer | Venue network may fail; the page must still render from a saved copy |
| Honest labels: "Cardano preprod", "test ADA", "earlier run" next to every tx; prices marked illustrative | Same honesty rule as the pitch (`pitch-plan.md` section 1) |
| Privacy: shelf photos with brands blurred and no people; never name the person, drink, brand or country of the real request | Consent rule (`pitch-plan.md` section 2) |
| No secrets, no full worker addresses; tx hashes copied from `../codigo/docs/evidence/tx-hashes.md`, never typed from memory | Repo is public |

## Sections in scroll order

Facts (tagline, prices, market numbers, team) come from [`slides/facts.tex`](slides/facts.tex), the single source; copy values from there. Timings refer to the run of show in [live-pitch.md](live-pitch.md).

| # | Section | Shown at | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Hook | 0:00-0:27 (Isabel) | One real shelf photo from Isabel's walk, full width. At most one line, e.g. "An AI can't see a shelf." No logo or tagline yet |
| 2 | Hero | 0:27-0:35 (Lorenz) | "Shelfie", tagline "Paid only when the photo is true.", subline "For brands entering a market without a field team." |
| 3 | How it works | 0:35 (Fernando), before switching to the demo tabs | Four steps as four cards: brand posts a job (fee in escrow on Cardano) -> a person in the store takes the photo with a one-time hand sign -> a verifier agent checks it (paid per check over x402) -> pass: worker paid, report delivered; fail: brand refunded |
| - | (live demo) | 0:35-2:00 | Not on the homepage: Sokosumi, app, verifier and explorer tabs |
| 4 | Receipts on Cardano | 2:00-2:17 (Lorenz) | Five rows: lock, x402 fee, payout, settle, refund; each with a short hash and "Cardano preprod, earlier run". Optional QR code per row (to be scanned, not clicked). Fee row says "logged" if it is not its own tx (B verifies) |
| 5 | Today / next | 2:17-2:35 (Lorenz) | "Test purchase: EUR 50+. Shelfie check: about EUR 12." (illustrative). Today: one shelf, preprod, one real request. Next: store QR codes for location, multi-store jobs |
| 6 | Close | 2:35-2:45 (Isabel) | "Nobody pays for a photo that isn't true." plus the tagline. Nothing else |
| 7+ | Below the close (Q&A, Devfolio visitors) | not scrolled on stage | Vision: "Agents will need eyes in the physical world; we make those eyes verifiable and paid." with the ladder (shelf checks -> deliveries, opening hours, accessibility). Market: the three figures with publisher and year (`pitch-plan.md` section 4). The verifier gates in one card row. Team: four names and roles. Links: repo, video |

Spoken text stays in `live-pitch.md`; the page shows less than is said, never more.
