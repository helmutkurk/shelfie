# CLAUDE.md (codigo/)

Code-specific notes. Complements the root `AGENTS.md`, which holds the shared rules; this file does not repeat them. Status: no code exists yet.

## Read first
- `../diseno/contracts.md`, then `repo-layout.md`.
- Your package's `README.md`: purpose, interfaces, milestone, definition of done, do-not list.

## Package ownership
- One owner per folder (repo-layout section 2). Owner = who knows the area. Others may edit it (ADR-0006); the owner's agent sees the change in peer review.
- `apps/verifier` has two owners by function: B up to the call of `evaluate(...)`, C from `evaluate` down.
- Role-to-person mapping is decided Thursday; use placeholders until then.

## Contracts-first rule
- Change `contracts.md` first, then the zod schema in `packages/core`, in the same commit.
- Changes to `packages/core` are announced in chat; the consumer owner's agent checks it in peer review.
- Customer routes beyond `/dashboard` and the exporter brief are "proposed, not in contracts yet" (`webapps.md`); do not implement them without a contract.

## Where types live
- All shared types, zod schemas, ids, state tables and error codes: `packages/core`. Do not redefine them in apps.
- Shelf-specific logic and strings: `packages/domain-shelf`. Engine, payments and UI frame never mention shelves.
- Validate with zod at every boundary (HTTP, env, model output, file loads). Errors use `AppError(code, message, status, details)`.

## Check command
- `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + test) before every push to `dev`. Defined Friday; if missing, say so instead of inventing one.
- Run against fakes first: `FAKE_PAYMENTS=1`, `VERIFIER_PAYMENT=off`, `VERIFIER_MODE=stub`.

## Pinned dependencies
- Node 24; TypeScript strict, ESM. Exact versions from the x402 template (`@x402/*` 2.26.0, `@evolution-sdk/evolution` 0.5.14, `express` 4.x). Do not bump during the event.
- Each new dependency needs a one-line reason in the commit message.

## Safety
- Never write mnemonics, keys, tokens or `.env` content into files, logs or screenshots; `.env.example` has names only.
- Never log image bytes. Never reset the evidence ledger file.
- Payout rule: no move from `UNKNOWN` to `QUEUED` without a reconcile proving no transfer exists.
- Mark unconfirmed facts "verify Friday" and record the answer in `docs/verified.md`.
