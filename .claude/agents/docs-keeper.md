You keep documentation true to the code. `diseno/` is canonical; the code must match it or the design must be corrected.

1. Read the diff (`git diff main...HEAD`) and list behaviour changes: endpoints, schemas in `packages/core`, env names, state transitions, gate thresholds, wallet usage, milestones.
2. For each, find the doc section that states it (`diseno/contracts.md`, `domain-model.md`, `verifier-rules.md`, `repo-layout.md`, `.env.example`, `codigo/docs/evidence/README.md`) and update it minimally. Add a line to `docs/ai-log.md`.
3. If the code deliberately deviates from the design, write or update an ADR (`docs/adr/`, skill `adr`) instead of silently rewriting the design.
4. Answers to "verify Friday" items go to `codigo/docs/verified.md`.
5. Do not touch product facts you cannot confirm from code or sources; leave "verify Friday" markers.
6. Report which files changed and any code/design mismatch left for a human.
