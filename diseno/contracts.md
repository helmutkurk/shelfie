# Contracts

Interfaces between components. JSON examples are illustrative; the zod schemas in `packages/core` are the source of truth once written, and must match this file (change this file first, then the schema, in the same commit).

## 0. Common conventions (read first)

- Base paths: engine `http://localhost:4000/api`, verifier `http://localhost:4021`. Public tunnel exposes only the engine.
- JSON everywhere except photo upload (JSON with base64, see 1.3; multipart is optional).
- IDs are prefixed strings. Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC strings. Money is a decimal string of lovelace.
- **Error body** (all components):
  ```json
  { "error": { "code": "claim_expired", "message": "Claim expired, claim the task again.", "details": {} } }
  ```
  `code` is stable and machine-readable (`snake_case`); `message` is shown to humans.
- Status codes: 200 ok, 201 created, 202 accepted (async), 400 `invalid_request`, 401 `unauthorized`, 402 payment required (verifier only), 404 `not_found`, 409 conflict states (`task_not_open`, `claim_expired`, `already_submitted`), 413 `image_too_large`, 422 `unprocessable` (schema ok, content not), 429 `rate_limited`, 500 `internal`, 503 `dependency_unavailable`.
- Auth: worker endpoints are open (a worker is identified by `workerId`, a random id kept in the phone's local storage, plus a payout address). Admin endpoints need header `X-Admin-Token: <ADMIN_TOKEN>`. Shell endpoints need `X-Shell-Token: <SHELL_TOKEN>`. Verifier admin endpoints need `X-Admin-Token`. The verifier `POST /v1/verify` is protected by x402 only (plus the optional `X-Engine-Token`, see 3.3).
- Rate limit the public worker endpoints (for example 30 requests per minute per IP) to survive a curious judge.
- CORS: engine serves the web app itself (same origin); no CORS needed. Verifier: none.

## 1. Engine API (owner: A; consumers: shell, web)

### 1.1 Jobs

**POST /api/jobs** (shell or admin): create a job. MVP scope (ADR-16): one job = one store, one product, one photo, one worker, so `stores` has exactly one entry, `n = 1`, `k = 1`. The arrays and `k` stay in the schema so multi-store jobs can return without a contract change (roadmap); the pack rejects `stores.length > 1` with `intake_rejected` / `multi_store_unsupported` until then.

Order of checks: (1) zod schema -> 422 `input_schema_violation`; (2) **intake filter** (section 1.1a) -> 422 `intake_rejected`; (3) only then tasks are planned and the job becomes `COLLECTING`. A job that fails step 2 is kept as `REJECTED_INPUT` with no tasks (section 1.1a); a step-1 schema failure stores nothing.

Request:
```json
{
  "packId": "shelf-check",
  "source": "shell",
  "externalRef": "sokosumi-task-id-or-demo-uuid",
  "input": {
    "productEan": "4000000000000",
    "stores": [ { "id": "s1" } ],
    "k": 1
  },
  "windowSec": 900
}
```
ADR-17: the input carries **ids only**, no free text. `productEan` and `stores[].id` must exist in the seeded catalogs (section 1.1a); the engine fills in name, aliases, chain, address, city, coordinates and geofence radius from the catalog, and the filled-in values are what tasks, verifier requests and reports use. `k` is optional and defaults to `n` (= 1 in the MVP). Free-text fields (`product.name`, `product.aliases`, `store.name`, `store.address`) are not part of the schema; a request that carries them is a 422 `input_schema_violation`. The brand dashboard form and the Sokosumi hire form (where the platform supports it) fill these ids from `GET /api/catalog` (section 1.1b).

Response 201 (or 200 if `externalRef` exists):
```json
{ "job": { "id": "job_01", "state": "COLLECTING", "n": 1, "k": 1, "windowEndsAt": "2000-01-01T00:00:00Z" }, "tasks": [ { "id": "tsk_01", "state": "OPEN", "spec": {} } ] }
```
Errors: 400 `invalid_request`, 422 `input_schema_violation` (details lists zod issues), 422 `intake_rejected` (section 1.1a), 401.

#### 1.1a Intake filter (admission gate)

With ADR-17 the brand dashboard cannot produce an invalid request (dropdowns, section 1.1b); the filter remains the **backstop** for every path that does not enforce the dropdowns: the Sokosumi hire form (if it has no option fields, *verify Friday*) and direct API calls. Runs inside `POST /api/jobs`, after schema validation and before `planTasks`, so an impossible job never creates tasks. Data: two seeded catalogs in the pack (`packages/domain-shelf/catalog/`), no live lookup.

| Catalog | Fields | Check |
|---|---|---|
| `stores.json` (known Munich stores) | `id`, `chain`, `name`, `address`, `city`, `lat`, `lon`, `geofenceRadiusM` | `stores[0].id` exists and `city == "Munich"`; `lat`/`lon` feed the capture-time location precheck, `geofenceRadiusM` (default 150 when absent) its radius |
| `products.json` | `ean`, `name`, `aliases[]`, `priceMinEur`, `priceMaxEur` | `productEan` exists; the range also feeds the `price_sanity` gate; names and aliases feed `product_match` and the out-of-stock label match |

Source: `investigacion/catalogo/stores.json` and `products.json` (written by another agent, not edited here); on Friday C copies them to `packages/domain-shelf/catalog/`. Exact field names are taken from those files; where they differ from this table, the files win and this table is corrected in the same commit (verify when the files land).

Rejection response (422). The job is stored in the terminal state `REJECTED_INPUT` (domain-model 2.1) with its reasons, and its id is returned in `details.jobId` so the shell can post the `INTAKE_REJECTED` settlement event and the dashboard can show it; no tasks are created and nothing is paid to anyone (Helmut, 2026-10-30; replaces "no job is created"):
```json
{ "error": { "code": "intake_rejected", "message": "Store is not in the supported Munich catalog.",
  "details": { "jobId": "job_...", "reasons": [ { "code": "unknown_store", "field": "input.stores[0].id" } ] } } }
```
Reason codes: `unknown_store`, `unknown_product`, `city_not_supported`, `multi_store_unsupported`, `catalog_mismatch` (a request that came with names or addresses that disagree with the catalog entry of the given id, only possible from paths that resolve free text to ids, such as the Sokosumi fallback). Messages are human-readable so the shell can pass them to the buyer.

Already-escrowed Sokosumi task that fails intake: the shell receives the 422, does **not** submit a result hash and posts a human-readable comment with the reasons on the task (same withhold path as ADR-11), so the buyer's no-result auto-refund applies; no worker was involved, so Shelfie loses nothing but the wait. The shell also posts `settlement-events` `INTAKE_REJECTED` for the ledger. Verify Friday: whether Sokosumi/Masumi lets the agent decline a task before payment (preferred, no escrow at all) or only after lock (then refund after timeout), and how fast that refund arrives.

#### 1.1b Catalog for dropdowns (public, read-only)

**GET /api/catalog** returns the choices the brand form shows, nothing else:
```json
{ "cities": [ { "id": "munich", "name": "Munich",
    "stores": [ { "id": "s1", "name": "Store A", "chain": "Chain X", "address": "Street 1, 80331 Munich" } ],
    "products": [ { "ean": "4000000000000", "name": "Example Pale Ale 0.33l" } ] } ] }
```
Dropdown order: city, then store (filtered by city), then product (filtered by city or by store if the catalog lists availability per store). No coordinates and no price ranges are returned. The form sends ids only. The MVP has one city, so the city dropdown has one entry but exists, so adding Berlin later is data, not UI.

**GET /api/jobs/{jobId}** returns the job with tasks, counts (`passed`, `failed`, `open`), `decision`, and `settlement`.

**GET /api/jobs** returns recent jobs (newest first), for the dashboard.

**GET /api/jobs/{jobId}/decision?waitSec=25** (shell): long poll. Returns when the job leaves `COLLECTING`/`DECIDING` or after `waitSec`.
```json
{ "jobId": "job_01", "status": "PENDING" }
```
or
```json
{ "jobId": "job_01", "status": "DELIVER", "outcomes": ["OBSERVED"], "passed": 1, "k": 1, "n": 1, "reportMd": "# Shelf check ...", "reportSha256": "..." }
```
`outcomes` is `["OBSERVED"]` for a price photo or `["OUT_OF_STOCK"]` for an out-of-stock observation; the report text states it ("out of stock at store X, time T"), and an out-of-stock `DELIVER` settles the escrow like any other.

or
```json
{ "jobId": "job_01", "status": "WITHHOLD", "passed": 0, "k": 1, "n": 1, "reason": "no_passing_photo" }
```

**POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/settlement-events** (shell): shell reports Masumi observations.
```json
{ "event": "RESULT_SUBMITTED", "txHash": null, "ref": "masumi-or-sokosumi-id", "note": "" }
```
`event` is one of `ESCROW_LOCKED`, `INTAKE_REJECTED`, `RESULT_SUBMITTED`, `SETTLED`, `WITHHELD`, `REFUND_OBSERVED`. `txHash` is optional but should be set whenever the shell knows one; the engine writes a ledger entry with an explorer URL.

**POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/cancel** (admin).

### 1.2 Tasks and claims

**GET /api/tasks?status=OPEN&lat=..&lon=..** returns tasks a worker can take (`id`, `jobId`, store name and address, product name, reward `payoutAmount`, `windowEndsAt`). Coordinates are coarse (rounded to about 1 km); the engine resolves the worker's city and returns only OPEN tasks in that city (without coordinates: 403 `location_required`). Does not leak codes or other workers' ids.

**GET /api/tasks/stream?lat=..&lon=..** (SSE, ADR-17 dispatch): events `task_opened` (full task object, sent to every worker in the city when a task becomes OPEN, including when a claim expires or is released), `task_closed` (`{taskId, reason: "claimed"|"done"|"expired"}`, sent when another worker wins the claim or the task ends) and a 15 s `ping`. The worker page falls back to polling `GET /api/tasks` every 3 s when the stream drops. Delivery is best effort; the claim endpoint is the source of truth.

**Worker location check (soft).** Claiming requires the worker's browser location to fall in the same city as the store. The page calls `navigator.geolocation` at claim time and sends coarse coordinates (rounded to about 1 km; not stored beyond the city decision, only `cityMatch` and `locationSource` are kept). The engine checks them against the city bounding box of the task's store city (Munich in the catalog). This is a demo-grade soft check: browser geolocation is spoofable and the result is a deterrent, not proof of presence (consistent with ADR-12; the challenge code still proves freshness only). If the browser denies permission or the check is disabled (`LOCATION_CHECK=off`, for stage rehearsals indoors), the claim fails with `location_required` unless an admin sets the flag, and any bypass is shown in the ledger.

**Atomic claim (first wins).** `claim` performs OPEN -> CLAIMED as one step; if two workers press at the same moment exactly one gets 201 and the other 409 `task_not_open` (message "Another worker was faster."). A worker with an active claim who claims a second task gets 409 `claim_already_active`.

**POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/claim**
```json
{ "workerId": "wrk_abc", "displayName": "Anna", "payoutAddress": "addr_test1...",
  "location": { "lat": 48.14, "lon": 11.58, "accuracyM": 800 } }
```
Response 201:
```json
{ "claim": { "id": "clm_01", "taskId": "tsk_01", "expiresAt": "...", "ttlSec": 300 },
  "challenge": { "code": "K7Q-4XM", "mode": "handwritten", "instruction": "Write this code on paper and hold it next to the price tag." },
  "task": { "product": "Example Pale Ale 0.33l", "store": "Store A" } }
```
Errors: 409 `task_not_open`, 409 `claim_already_active`, 422 `invalid_payout_address` (must parse as a preprod address), 403 `location_required` (permission denied or missing `location`), 403 `wrong_city` (worker is not in the store's city; `details.storeCity`), 409 `claim_window_closed` (after the claim cutoff, see section 1.6), 429. Repeating the call by the same worker while the claim is active returns the same claim.

**POST /api/claims/{claimId}/release** gives the task back (worker taps cancel).

### 1.3 Submissions

**POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/submissions**
```json
{ "claimId": "clm_01", "outcome": "OBSERVED", "imageBase64": "<jpeg bytes, no data: prefix>", "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "location": { "lat": 48.1371, "lon": 11.5754, "accuracyM": 18, "fixAgeMs": 1200 },
  "clientMeta": { "captureMode": "getUserMedia", "width": 1600, "height": 1200, "userAgent": "...",
                  "streamStartedToShutterMs": 8400, "deviceLabelPresent": true } }
```
- `outcome` is `OBSERVED` (default) or `OUT_OF_STOCK` (the worker used "Product not on the shelf", ADR-17); it selects the gate set (verifier-rules.md sections 2 and 2a).
- `location` is read from `navigator.geolocation` when the shutter is pressed (fresh fix, `maximumAge: 0`). It is **required**: missing -> 403 `location_required`.
- `clientMeta.captureMode` must be `getUserMedia`; anything else (`file`, `capture-input`, missing) -> 422 `capture_mode_not_allowed`. `streamStartedToShutterMs` and `deviceLabelPresent` are advisory signals only (a page cannot prove a live capture; section "limits" below). Canvas output has no EXIF; an upload that arrives with camera EXIF is logged as the advisory flag `exifPresent` and never decides.
- **Location precheck (engine, before the verifier, no fee).** `distanceM = haversine(location, store.lat/lon)`. Pass if `distanceM <= geofenceRadiusM + min(accuracyM, ACCURACY_CAP_M)`. Radius from `stores.json` (`geofenceRadiusM`), default `DEFAULT_GEOFENCE_M` = 150; `ACCURACY_CAP_M` default 100. `accuracyM > 300` or `fixAgeMs > 30000` -> 422 `location_inaccurate` ("Wait for a better GPS signal and try again"); otherwise too far -> 422 `location_mismatch` with `details: { distanceM, allowedM }`. Neither failure verifies, charges, burns the code or consumes an attempt; the claim stays active and `locationTries` increments; after `LOCATION_MAX_TRIES` (default 3) the claim is released. `LOCATION_CHECK=off` disables the precheck (flagged rehearsal switch, ledger entry; never in an evidence run). Every outcome writes `LOCATION_CHECKED` to the ledger (distance and pass/fail, not coordinates). Soft check: spoofable and poor indoors; it is a deterrent, not proof.
- **Limits, stated plainly:** the server cannot know that bytes came from a live camera. A modified browser, an emulator or a virtual camera sends the same request, and a phone aimed at a screen or printout is a live capture. The real defences are the single-use challenge code (cannot exist before the claim), the server-side timing gate and duplicate hashes. Camera-only blocks the cheap gallery cheat, not a determined one.
- **Admin test path:** with `ALLOW_TEST_UPLOAD=true` and `X-Admin-Token`, `captureMode: "admin-test"` is accepted for scripted tests and the smoke script; ledger-flagged, must be `false` in every evidence run.
Response 202:
```json
{ "submission": { "id": "sub_01", "state": "VERIFYING", "queuePosition": 1 } }
```
Errors: 403 `location_required`, 422 `location_mismatch` / `location_inaccurate`, 422 `capture_mode_not_allowed`, 409 `claim_expired` / `already_submitted`, 413 `image_too_large` (limit `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, default 2 MB after client-side resize), 422 `image_not_decodable`, 422 `duplicate_image`.

**GET /api/submissions/{submissionId}** (worker polls every 2 s or uses SSE):
```json
{ "id": "sub_01", "state": "REJECTED",
  "verdict": { "outcome": "OBSERVED", "pass": false, "failedGates": ["code_match"],
               "workerMessage": "We could not read the code ABC-123 in your photo. Hold the paper closer and try again.",
               "extraction": { "priceText": "2.49", "productText": "Example Pale Ale" } },
  "task": { "id": "tsk_01", "state": "OPEN", "attemptsLeft": 2 },
  "payout": null }
```
On pass, `payout` becomes `{ "state": "QUEUED|SENDING|SUBMITTED|CONFIRMED", "txHash": "...", "explorerUrl": "https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/transaction/..." }`.

### 1.4 Payouts, ledger, health, config

- **GET /api/payouts?jobId=** list with states and tx hashes.
- **GET /api/ledger?afterSeq=0&limit=200** returns EvidenceEntry list; **GET /api/ledger/stream** is Server-Sent Events with the same entry objects (`event: entry`). The dashboard uses SSE with a 3 s polling fallback.
- **GET /api/health** returns `{ "ok": true, "packId": "...", "network": "preprod", "wallets": { "vbuy": { "balanceLovelace": "..." }, "pay": { "balanceLovelace": "...", "queueDepth": 0 } }, "verifier": "up|down", "fakes": { "payments": false, "verifier": false } }`. The dashboard shows a red banner if any `fakes.*` is true or a balance is below `MIN_WALLET_LOVELACE`.
- **GET /api/config** returns pack UI labels, explorer base URL, challenge mode, `secureContext` hint, `demoOverrideEnabled` (so the UI can show the badge).

### 1.5 Admin (header `X-Admin-Token`)

- **POST /api/admin/submissions/{id}/override** `{ "pass": true, "reason": "vision misread, tag visible" }`: only if `ALLOW_DEMO_OVERRIDE=true`; creates a superseding Verdict with `source = MANUAL_OVERRIDE`, ledger entry flagged `demoOverride`. 403 `override_disabled` otherwise.
- **POST /api/admin/payouts/{id}/reconcile**, **/retry**, **/mark-paid** `{ "txHash": "..." }` (see domain-model section 6).
- **POST /api/admin/jobs/{id}/finalize** forces the decision now (used to end a demo job early).
- **POST /api/admin/reset** clears jobs and the engine event log; refused when `NODE_ENV=production` or when any evidence run is flagged `locked`. Never reset the evidence ledger file.

### 1.6 Shell bridge (owner: A; the only shell code of ours)

One file in the fork, called from the starter's `answer(input, journal, deadline)` path (names from the runbook; verify Friday that this is the right seam):

1. Parse the Sokosumi task description / input into the pack's `jobInput` (ids only, ADR-17). The Coworker input schema mirrors it with option fields from `GET /api/catalog` if Sokosumi supports select/enum fields (*verify Friday*); otherwise the shell keeps a free-text fallback that resolves product and store to catalog ids (LLM or fuzzy match) and sends only ids, and an unresolvable request becomes `intake_rejected`.
2. `POST /api/jobs` with `externalRef = sokosumiTaskId`. Idempotent, so a restarted worker resumes.
   A 422 `intake_rejected` is handled as in section 1.1a (no hash, comment with reasons).
3. Long-poll `GET /api/jobs/{id}/decision` until `DELIVER`, `WITHHOLD` or the shell deadline.
4. `DELIVER`: return `reportMd` as the result, so the starter hashes and submits it. `WITHHOLD`: throw the quality-failed error the starter treats as "no hash, no completion", with a human-readable comment on the Sokosumi task (verify Friday: exact mechanism, runbook section 4 says stock behaviour blocks on errors and a "failed" text would be paid).
5. Post `settlement-events` for every Masumi observation the starter already logs.

**Timing budget.** The task window must close well before the Masumi submit deadline: `JOB_WINDOW_SEC` <= submit deadline minus 8 minutes. Inside the window, no new claim is issued after the claim cutoff `windowEndsAt - CLAIM_TTL_SEC - VERIFY_BUDGET_SEC` (`VERIFY_BUDGET_SEC` default 120: a serialised x402 verify takes 20 to 60 s), so a last claim can still be submitted and verified before the window ends; claims after the cutoff get 409 `claim_window_closed`. After the window the engine decides within about 1 minute, and the shell needs the remaining margin (`SHELL_DEADLINE_MARGIN_SEC`, default 300) to hash and submit a `DELIVER` result. Example: submit deadline 30 min after lock -> `JOB_WINDOW_SEC=900` (15 min), cutoff at minute 8 with `CLAIM_TTL_SEC=300`, `VERIFY_BUDGET_SEC=120`. The actual submit deadline is a Masumi/Sokosumi parameter (verify Friday; ask whether it can be shortened).

## 2. Browser package entry points

Web imports shared schemas, types, errors and public env parsing from `@shelfie/core/browser`.
This entry point has no Node built-ins, logger, payment ports or server env names.
`@shelfie/evidence/explorer` exposes explorer URL helpers without filesystem access.
The server entry points remain `@shelfie/core` and `@shelfie/evidence`.

## 3. Verifier service (owner: B for the x402 wrapper, C for the gate)

### 3.1 Paid endpoint

`POST /v1/verify`. Protected by the x402 seller middleware, route key `"POST /v1/verify"`.

Payment requirements (served in the 402 response):
```json
{ "scheme": "exact", "network": "cardano:preprod",
  "price": { "amount": "1000000", "asset": "lovelace" },
  "payTo": "<W-SELL address from env SELLER_ADDRESS>",
  "description": "One shelf-photo verification", "mimeType": "application/json" }
```
- **Price: 1 tADA** (`VERIFY_PRICE_LOVELACE=1000000`). Lovelace routes need at least 1 tADA (min UTxO, x402 runbook), so this is the floor. If the facilitator rejects 1 tADA (verify Friday), use 2000000 and adjust the budget. Price is per check, regardless of pass or fail.
- Asset: lovelace, to avoid the two tUSDM token variants (x402 runbook section 1).
- The buyer caps spend: `maxAmountPerPayment = 2000000` (`VERIFY_MAX_PRICE_LOVELACE`).

Request headers: `Content-Type: application/json`, `Idempotency-Key: verify:<submissionId>`, optional `X-Engine-Token`.

`task.outcome` is `OBSERVED` or `OUT_OF_STOCK` (the worker's claim); the verifier runs the matching gate set and returns the same value in `outcome` (verifier-rules.md sections 2 and 2a). Location is **not** sent: the engine prechecks it (ADR-17).

Request body:
```json
{
  "packId": "shelf-check",
  "submissionId": "sub_01",
  "task": {
    "taskId": "tsk_01",
    "product": { "name": "Example Pale Ale 0.33l", "ean": "4000000000000", "aliases": ["example pale ale"] },
    "store": { "id": "s1", "name": "Store A" },
    "expectedCode": "K7Q-4XM",
    "outcome": "OBSERVED",
    "claimIssuedAt": "...", "taskWindowEndsAt": "...", "receivedAt": "..."
  },
  "image": { "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "base64": "<bytes>", "sha256": "<hex>" },
  "previousImageSha256": ["<hex of other accepted photos in the same job>"]
}
```
Response 200 (after the paid retry; includes header `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` with the receipt, carrying `transaction`):
```json
{
  "submissionId": "sub_01",
  "outcome": "OBSERVED",
  "pass": false,
  "gates": [
    { "name": "image_ok", "pass": true },
    { "name": "code_match", "pass": false, "reasonCode": "code_mismatch", "detail": { "expected": "K7Q-4XM", "seen": "K7Q-4XN" } }
  ],
  "failedGates": ["code_match"],
  "extraction": { "...": "see verifier-rules.md section 3" },
  "workerMessage": "We could not read the code K7Q-4XM in your photo. Hold the paper closer and try again.",
  "model": { "provider": "env", "id": "env", "latencyMs": 3100 },
  "cached": false
}
```
Errors before payment settles (these must not charge the buyer; the middleware order makes validation errors return before settle only if the handler runs pre-settle, so validation lives in a pre-middleware): 400 `invalid_request`, 413 `image_too_large`, 422 `image_not_decodable`, 503 `vision_unavailable` (verify Friday where in the template's flow a handler error lands relative to settle; the template README says the handler runs after verify and before settle).

A decode failure in pre-payment validation returns HTTP 422 `image_not_decodable` and makes no payment or model call. A gate-level decode failure returns a verdict reason `image_undecodable` under `image_ok`; it is not an HTTP error code.

Idempotency behaviour: the paid handler can run more than once on retries (template README). The handler looks up `Idempotency-Key`; on a hit it returns the cached verdict with `"cached": true` and never calls the vision model again.

### 3.2 Other verifier endpoints

- **GET /health** `{ "ok": true, "packId": "...", "visionConfigured": true }`.
- **GET /v1/price** (free) returns the current price and `payTo`, so the dashboard can show "verification costs 1 tADA per check".
- **POST /v1/verify-dry** (admin, no payment): same body and response as `/v1/verify` without x402; used by the evaluation runner and by the engine's `VERIFIER_PAYMENT=off` dev mode. Absent when `ENABLE_DRY=false`; must be `false` in the evidence runs (the engine refuses to count a dry verdict toward evidence).
- **POST /v1/extract** (admin, no payment): returns only the vision extraction JSON for prompt tuning.

### 3.3 Calling the verifier from the engine

`packages/payments` exposes (illustrative signature):
```ts
interface VerifyClient {
  verify(req: VerifyRequest, key: string): Promise<{ verdict: VerifyResponse; txHash: string; receipt: unknown }>;
}
```
Implementation: `wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, x402Client)` with signer from `VBUY_MNEMONIC`, `setSpendControls({ allowedAssets: [{ network: "cardano:*", asset: "lovelace", maxAmountPerPayment: VERIFY_MAX_PRICE_LOVELACE }] })`, serial queue per wallet, receipt store keyed by idempotency key. A fake (`VERIFIER_PAYMENT=off`) calls `/v1/verify-dry`.

## 4. Payments package interfaces (owner: B)

```ts
interface PayoutAdapter {            // plain transfer, SDK specifics hidden (verify Friday)
  send(args: { toAddress: string; lovelace: string; metadataTag: string }): Promise<{ txHash: string }>;
  find(args: { metadataTag: string; sinceIso: string }): Promise<{ txHash: string } | null>;  // reconcile
  confirmations(txHash: string): Promise<number>;
  balance(): Promise<string>;
}
interface PayoutQueue {
  enqueue(p: { taskId: string; toAddress: string; lovelace: string }): Promise<Payout>;   // idempotent on taskId
  get(id: string): Promise<Payout>;
  reconcile(id: string): Promise<Payout>;
}
```
Fake adapters: `FakePayoutAdapter` (instant fake hashes, can inject timeouts, duplicates and crashes for tests) and `FakeVerifyClient` (returns scripted verdicts). The engine runs entirely on the fakes with `FAKE_PAYMENTS=1`; the dashboard then shows the red "FAKE PAYMENTS" banner.

## 5. Environment variables (names only; values live in untracked env files)

### 5.1 Shared (all components, loaded from `.env`)

`NODE_ENV`, `NETWORK` (always `preprod`), `LOG_LEVEL`, `PACK_ID`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, `EXPLORER_TX_BASE` (default `https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/transaction/`), `EXPLORER_ADDRESS_BASE`.

### 5.2 Engine

`ENGINE_PORT`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_GEOFENCE_M` (150), `ACCURACY_CAP_M` (100), `LOCATION_MAX_TRIES` (3), `ALLOW_TEST_UPLOAD` (false), `SHELL_TOKEN`, `ENGINE_TOKEN`, `VERIFIER_URL`, `VERIFIER_PAYMENT` (`on` or `off`), `FAKE_PAYMENTS`, `JOB_WINDOW_SEC`, `CLAIM_TTL_SEC`, `VERIFY_BUDGET_SEC`, `LOCATION_CHECK` (`on` or `off`), `MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`, `PAYOUT_LOVELACE`, `PAYOUT_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `PAYOUT_WALLETS`, `VBUY_WALLETS`, `MIN_WALLET_LOVELACE`, `ALLOW_DEMO_OVERRIDE`, `STORE_PATH`, `LEDGER_PATH`, `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID`, `PAY_MNEMONIC_1`, `PAY_MNEMONIC_2` (one variable per payout wallet, never a list), `VBUY_MNEMONIC_1`, `VBUY_MNEMONIC_2`, `VERIFY_MAX_PRICE_LOVELACE`, `FACILITATOR_URL`.

Additional engine names: `SELLER_ADDRESS` (public preprod payee pin, required for real paid verification), `PAYOUT_DAILY_CAP_LOVELACE` (integer lovelace, default 50000000), `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma-separated hostnames), `CATALOG_DIR` (catalog directory), `WEB_DIST` (built web directory), `VERIFY_CLIENT` (`fake` or `real`; defaults to fake with fake payments), `PAYMENTS_IMPL` (`package` or `engine-fake`; default package), `PAYOUT_STORE_PATH` (queue file, default `payout-queue.json` beside `STORE_PATH`), `EVIDENCE_RUN_LOCKED` (false; locks admin reset).

### 5.3 Verifier

`VERIFIER_PORT`, `VERIFIER_PAYMENT` (`on` by default; `off` implies dry endpoints unless explicitly disabled and is refused in production), `VERIFIER_MODE` (`stub` or `live`), `VISION_RUN_CAP` (optional positive integer, outbound model-call cap), `SELLER_ADDRESS`, `FACILITATOR_URL`, `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID` (only if running a local facilitator), `VERIFY_PRICE_LOVELACE`, `VISION_PROVIDER`, `VISION_MODEL`, `VISION_BASE_URL`, `VISION_API_KEY`, `VISION_FALLBACK_BASE_URL`, `VISION_FALLBACK_MODEL`, `VISION_FALLBACK_API_KEY`, `VISION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VISION_MAX_TOKENS`, `ENABLE_DRY`, `IDEMPOTENCY_CACHE_PATH`, `IDEMPOTENCY_TTL_SEC`, `X_ENGINE_TOKEN_REQUIRED`, `ENGINE_TOKEN`.

### 5.4 Shell (names from the starter and runbook; ours are marked)

Starter/Masumi: `COWORKER_ID`, `EVE_PORT`, `EVE_URL`, `PAID_TASKS_ENABLED`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `ZAI_BASE_URL`, `ZAI_MODEL`, `ZAI_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS`, `MPS_URL`, `AGENT_API_PORT`, `AGENT_AUTHOR`, `SOKOSUMI_ORGANIZATION_ID`, `SOKOSUMI_ORGANIZATION_SLUG`. MPS side: `DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `ADMIN_KEY`, `BLOCKFROST_API_KEY_PREPROD`, `PORT`.
Ours: `ENGINE_URL`, `SHELL_TOKEN`, `SHELL_DECISION_POLL_SEC`, `SHELL_DEADLINE_MARGIN_SEC`.

### 5.5 Web (build-time)

`VITE_API_BASE` (empty for same origin), `VITE_DEMO_BADGES`. Dev proxy only: `VITE_ENGINE_URL` (defaults to loopback at `ENGINE_PORT`, or 4000). It is not needed in the browser runtime.

### 5.6 Hub scripts

`TUNNEL_PROVIDER`, `TUNNEL_URL_FILE`, `HUB_LAN_IP`. Funding check: `WALLET_ADDRESS_VBUY`, `WALLET_ADDRESS_PAY`, `WALLET_ADDRESS_MPS` (public preprod addresses), `SELLER_ADDRESS`, `BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID`, `MIN_WALLET_LOVELACE`. All addresses and network configuration are validated before a request.

Never commit values; ship `.env.example` files with names only. Wallets are throwaway.

## 6. Domain pack config shape (owner: C)

Declarative `pack.config.json` plus a TypeScript module for logic. Illustrative:

      { "name": "timing", "params": { "minSecondsAfterClaim": 5 } },
      { "name": "not_duplicate", "params": {} }
    ],
    "payoutLovelace": "3000000",
    "reportTemplateRef": "./report/oos.md.hbs"
  },
  "location": { "defaultGeofenceM": 150, "accuracyCapM": 100, "maxAccuracyM": 300, "maxFixAgeMs": 30000, "maxTries": 3 },
  "payout": { "amountLovelace": "3000000", "perTask": true },
  "jobInput": { "idsOnly": true, "maxStores": 1, "catalogs": { "stores": "./catalog/stores.json", "products": "./catalog/products.json" }, "city": "Munich" },
  "settlement": { "rule": "k-of-n", "kDefault": "n", "earlyDeliver": false },
  "report": { "templateRef": "./report/report.md.hbs", "columns": ["store", "price", "verdict", "evidenceTx", "payoutTx"] },
  "ui": { "taskTitle": "Check {product} at {store}", "claimButton": "Take this task", "doneMessage": "Verified. Payment sent." }
}
```
`settlement.kDefault` is `n`, and `maxStores` is 1 in the MVP, so every job is N=1, K=1 (ADR-16). Raising `maxStores` and `k` re-enables multi-store jobs without engine changes (roadmap).

Rule names map to functions exported by the pack module (`rules.ts`); unknown names fail startup. Thresholds are tuned from the 20-photo run (verifier-rules.md section 7), not guessed.

For Plan B the same shape holds with `worker.kind = "agent"`, `challenge = null`, other rules and `payout.amountLovelace = "0"` (queue idle).
