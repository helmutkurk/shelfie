# Web apps: worker side and customer side

Status: proposal built on `contracts.md`, `architecture.md` and `verifier-rules.md` (canonical). Added 2026-10-29 after Helmut's request for two sides of the web app; updated the same day for ADR-17 (dispatch to all workers, camera only, location at capture, catalog-only requests, out of stock). Visual system and screen layouts: [ui-design.md](ui-design.md); this file keeps behaviour, flows and wireframes of the functional structure. Where the two differ on looks, `ui-design.md` wins; on behaviour, this file and `contracts.md` win. Where this file and `contracts.md` disagree, `contracts.md` wins; change it first. Nothing here is built before Friday 09:00. Items marked *inference* are our reading; items marked *decide Friday* are open.

Both sides live in one app, `apps/web` (Vite + React, owner D), served by the engine from the same origin:

| Side | Route | Audience | Layout | In contracts.md? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Worker app | `/w` | People in stores and on the street who take shelf photos (or report an empty shelf spot) | Mobile first, one hand, bright light | Yes (architecture.md component 5) |
| Customer app | `/dashboard` | Whoever needs the data and watches the job | Desktop and stage layout, readable on a phone | Yes (component 6) |
| Customer app, extra routes | `/dashboard/new`, `/dashboard/jobs/:id`, `/dashboard/jobs/:id/report`, `/dashboard/ledger`, `/dashboard/entry-brief` | Same | Same | **Proposed, not in contracts yet** |

MVP vs later is summarised in section 6. The market-entry brief (section 4.3) is roadmap; the MVP builds only the shelf-check job.

## 1. Personas

| Persona | Side | Status | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Street worker** (student, gig worker; role not yet researched) | Worker | MVP; teammates play it in the demo | Earn a small payout for a quick, verifiable photo |
| **Katharina Brandl**, field-sales manager at Isarquell (fictional, from `pitch/storyline.md`) | Customer | MVP persona | Know today whether her 0.33 l bottle is on the shelf in a given Munich store, and at what price (MVP: one store per job; several stores per job is roadmap, ADR-16) |
| **Exporter** (example from Helmut: a producer in South America that wants to introduce a product into the German market) | Customer | Roadmap persona (product-roadmap.md) | Understand shelf prices, competitors and positioning in German stores before committing to the market |
| **Operator** (a teammate with the admin token) | Dashboard, admin | MVP | Run demos, override (labelled), reconcile payouts |

Name, company and country of the exporter are not defined: *decide Friday* whether the pitch uses a fictional exporter at all (Katharina stays the spine, `storyline.md` rule).

## 2. Worker app (`/w`)

### 2.1 Jobs to be done

- When I have ten spare minutes near a supermarket, I want to see tasks nearby with the reward, so I can decide fast.
- When I take a task, I want unambiguous instructions and a one-time code, so my photo is accepted the first time.
- When my photo is rejected, I want to know exactly why, so I can fix it without losing the task.
- When my photo passes, I want to see the payout and a verifiable receipt, so I trust that I will be paid.

### 2.2 Journey

1. Open `/w` (QR code or link). A random `workerId` is created in local storage (contracts.md section 0). **Sign in with wallet** (screen W0): on a browser with a CIP-30 wallet (`window.cardano`), "Connect wallet" reads the payout address; otherwise paste a preprod address (or scan its QR). No signature, no password: the address is the identity and payout target; address ownership is not proven (the risk is the worker's own). Whether mobile wallet browsers expose CIP-30 on the venue phones: *verify Friday*; paste is the guaranteed path.
2. First run: display name, a short privacy rule (shelves only, no people), and the location permission explanation (city feed, then the shot).
3. Feed (W1): open tasks in the worker's city, live. When a new job arrives all workers in Munich see it at once (SSE `task_opened`); when someone else claims it, it disappears from every other feed (`task_closed`) with a short fade, and a worker who taps late sees "Another worker was faster." First claim wins (ADR-17).
4. Tap a task for detail (W2), then "Take this task" (`POST /api/tasks/{id}/claim`). The challenge code and countdown appear (W3, TTL 300 s). The claim holds the task for that time; if it expires the task returns to every feed.
5. Write the code on paper (mode `handwritten`) or take a printed card (mode `card-pool`). Go to the shelf.
6. Two ways to finish, both from W3 and from the camera sheet: the primary path "Open camera" for the price photo, and the clear secondary action **"Product not on the shelf"** that switches the sheet to out-of-stock framing (empty spot, shelf label, code).
7. Camera sheet (W4): live camera only, no gallery or file option anywhere. The sheet shows the code and countdown, a location status line (reading, accurate, weak signal), and the shutter. On shutter the page reads a fresh location fix and sends photo and location together (`POST /api/tasks/{id}/submissions`). Over HTTP (no secure context) the sheet is replaced by a notice to open the secure link; the worker cannot submit from there.
8. Location precheck result comes back immediately: too far from the store or fix too weak -> the sheet stays open with the reason and the distance, no fee, no attempt used; the worker can step closer or wait for a better fix and shoot again with the same code (up to 3 tries).
9. Wait for verification (state `VERIFYING`, queue position shown). Poll `GET /api/submissions/{id}` every 2 s.
10. Result: PASS (payout state moves QUEUED, SENDING, SUBMITTED, CONFIRMED, with explorer link; out-of-stock shows its own wording, W6b) or FAIL (reason in plain words, attempts left, "Try again" gets a new claim and a new code).
11. Back to the feed.

Empty state: "No tasks in Munich right now. New ones appear here as they arrive." Location off: "Allow location to see tasks in your city." with a button.

**W2 Task detail**

|   Product not on the shelf     |
|        Give task back          |
+--------------------------------+
```
The code is shown here but the photo must contain the paper; the phone that shoots cannot show its own screen. "Product not on the shelf" is a text-weight secondary action, never the same weight as the primary button, never hidden.

**W4 Camera sheet (full-height sheet over W3)**
```
+--------------------------------+
| Cancel      Price photo        |
|  [live camera preview]         |
|   +------------------------+   |

|        (  shutter  )           |
| Product not on the shelf       |
+--------------------------------+
```
No upload button. The location line reads: "Getting location...", "Location ok", "Weak signal, wait or go outside" (shutter stays enabled; the engine decides), "Location off. Allow it in the browser" (shutter disabled: location is required). In out-of-stock mode (`Cancel      Empty shelf spot`) the frame guide shows "label + empty spot + paper", with the hint "Show the shelf label and the empty space above it."

**W5 Result, fail**
```
+--------------------------------+
|  Not accepted                  |
| We could not read the code     |

+--------------------------------+
```
Text comes from `verdict.workerMessage`. A location refusal is shown in the camera sheet (W4), not here, because no attempt was used.

**W6 Result, pass and payout**

```
tADA has no market value (storyline units note); never show a EUR equivalent in the demo.

**W6b Result, out of stock accepted**
```
+--------------------------------+
|  Verified: not on the shelf    |
| Label read: Example Pale Ale   |
| Payout 3 tADA (same as a       |

|        [ Next task ]           |
+--------------------------------+
```
Out-of-stock failure uses W5 with the O-gate messages (verifier-rules.md section 2a), for example "A product is visible at this spot. If it is there, use the normal price photo."

### 2.4 Endpoints per screen

| Screen | Endpoints (contracts.md) |
|---|---|
| W0 | none (local storage); optional CIP-30 read in the browser |
| W1 | `GET /api/config` (labels, explorer base, challenge mode, `secureContext` hint), `GET /api/tasks?status=OPEN&lat=&lon=`, `GET /api/tasks/stream` (SSE `task_opened` / `task_closed`, polling fallback 3 s) |
| W2/W3 | `POST /api/tasks/{id}/claim`, `POST /api/claims/{id}/release` |
| W4 | `POST /api/tasks/{id}/submissions` (photo, `outcome`, `location`, `captureMode: getUserMedia`) |
| W5/W6/W6b | `GET /api/submissions/{id}` (poll; SSE not specified for submissions) |

### 2.5 States and errors to show

| Camera denied | browser | Explain how to allow the camera in the browser settings; there is no upload alternative |

### 2.6 Accessibility, i18n, privacy

- Accessibility: tap targets at least 44 px; text contrast AA; countdown also as text, not colour only; camera screen has a visible non-gesture shutter; result states announced with `aria-live`; works in portrait with one hand.
- i18n: English strings in MVP; all strings come from `GET /api/config` pack labels or one message catalogue so German is cheap to add; Spanish later (needed for South American users and customers). Server `workerMessage` is English in MVP; localised reason codes are roadmap (*inference*: map `reasonCode` to catalogue keys client-side).
- Privacy rules shown to the worker and enforced as far as the design allows: shelves and price tags only, no people in frame (advisory `peopleVisible` flag only warns, it does not gate; verifier-rules section 3); do not photograph staff or customers; ask a store employee if unsure; photos are kept on the hub during the event and deleted after (verifier-rules). The worker app stores only `workerId`, display name and payout address locally. Browser location is read twice, coarsely for the city feed and precisely at the shutter; the engine keeps only the distance and the pass/fail, not coordinates (contracts.md section 1.3), and the page says so. The code proves freshness, not location; the location check is a soft deterrent.

## 3. Customer app, shelf-check job (MVP)

### 3.1 Jobs to be done (Katharina)

- When I have launched a product in a chain, I want to know within the hour whether it is on the shelf and at what price, so I can act the same day.
- When a check fails, I want not to pay for it, so I can trust the bill.
- When I show the data to my boss or the buyer, I want a report and a receipt for each store, so the data is defensible.

### 3.2 Journey

1. MVP order path: hire the lead agent on Sokosumi (product and one Munich store; ids from the catalogs, option fields if Sokosumi supports them, *verify Friday*); escrow locks the fee. The shell creates the job in the engine (`POST /api/jobs`, source `shell`), which first applies the intake filter against the seeded store and product catalogs; a rejected request gets a clear reason (contracts.md section 1.1a) and the escrow refunds without a worker.
2. Open `/dashboard`; the new job appears (`GET /api/jobs`).
3. Watch the task status turn from open to claimed, verifying, passed or failed (retries show as further attempts), with the payout and verification spend.
4. Job leaves `COLLECTING`: decision `DELIVER` (the observation passed: a price photo, or an out-of-stock photo reported as "out of stock at store X, time T") or `WITHHOLD` (no passing photo by the window end).
5. Read the report (table of store, price, verdict, evidence tx, payout tx). On `WITHHOLD`, see the refund path.
6. Open the ledger and click explorer links.

Demo shortcut: a "demo job" button on the dashboard creates a job through the admin path (design README: fake shell via `POST /api/jobs` from the dashboard's button). That button needs the admin token and is an operator tool, not a customer feature.

### 3.3 Screens

**C1 New request** (brand dashboard; the operator/demo path in the MVP, the customer-facing form later)
```
+--------------------------------------------------------+
| New shelf check                                        |

|                              [ Request check ]         |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
```
ADR-17: the three fields are dropdowns fed by `GET /api/catalog`; there is **no free-text field**, so an unknown store, product or city cannot be requested. Store is enabled after city, product after store (list filtered by the catalog). The button stays disabled until all three are chosen. The form sends `input = { productEan, stores: [{ id }] }` and `windowSec` (contracts.md section 1.1). The operator "Demo job" button uses the same ids. In MVP the real order is placed on Sokosumi; this form is the operator/demo path, and a customer-facing create needs customer auth and payment, which the contracts do not have. The Sokosumi hire form is outside our control: if its input schema has no option/select fields, a free-text value reaches the shell and the intake filter is the backstop (*verify Friday*).

Rendered from `reportMd` of the decision (contracts 1.1); the table columns come from the pack `report.columns`. For an out-of-stock result the row reads "Not on the shelf at Store A, 14:32" with the photo of the empty spot as evidence; the escrow settles like any delivered result (layout: ui-design.md B4).

### 3.4 Endpoints per screen

| Screen | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| C1 | `GET /api/catalog` (dropdowns), `POST /api/jobs` (needs `X-Shell-Token` or `X-Admin-Token`; fine for operator, not for public customers) |
| C2 | `GET /api/jobs`, `GET /api/jobs/{id}`, `GET /api/ledger/stream` (SSE, polling fallback every 3 s), `GET /api/health`, `GET /api/config` |
| C3 | `GET /api/jobs/{id}` (includes `decision`, `settlement`), `GET /api/jobs/{id}/decision` for `reportMd` |
| C4 | `GET /api/ledger?afterSeq=`, `GET /api/ledger/stream`, `GET /api/payouts?jobId=`, `GET /api/health`, `GET /v1/price` on the verifier (dashboard shows the verification price) |
| Operator tools | `/api/admin/*` (override, reconcile, finalize, reset) behind `X-Admin-Token`; hidden unless the token is entered |

Whether `GET /api/jobs/{id}` already exposes `reportMd` is not stated; contracts 1.1 lists it on the decision endpoint. *Verify Friday*, or use `/decision`.

### 3.5 States and errors

Job states: RECEIVED, COLLECTING, DECIDING, DELIVERABLE, DELIVERED, SETTLED, WITHHELD, REFUNDED, CANCELLED, REJECTED_INPUT (domain-model 2.1). Task states: OPEN, CLAIMED, SUBMITTED, VERIFYING, ACCEPTED, PAID, FAILED, EXPIRED. Show: red banner if `fakes.*` is true or a balance is under `MIN_WALLET_LOVELACE`; badge for `demoOverride`; "reconnecting" when SSE drops (switch to polling); 401 on admin actions; 422 `input_schema_violation` with zod issues on C1; empty state "No jobs yet".

### 3.6 Accessibility, i18n, privacy

Status never by colour alone (icon plus text); table is a real `<table>` with headers; stage layout has a large-font mode; explorer links open in a new tab with visible destination text. English in MVP; German next (Katharina), Spanish later (exporter). Customer pages never show worker payout addresses or display names beyond what the report needs; photos are evidence for disputes, not published; shelves only. Worker identity stays out of the report by default (*proposal*).

## 4. Customer app, exporter (market-entry brief): roadmap

The exporter (for example a South American producer) needs a market analysis for entering Germany: shelf prices, costs, competitors, marketing and positioning in German stores. The hackathon MVP does not build this. It reuses what the MVP produces (verified shelf price and placement observations) and adds aggregation and desk research. Facts about the market are not provided here; any number in a real brief must come from a source or from verified shelf data.

### 4.1 Jobs to be done

- When I consider entering Germany, I want to see what comparable products cost on the shelf, by store type and city, so I can set a viable price.
- I want to see who the competitors are, how they are placed and presented, so I can choose positioning.
- I want to know the landed-cost and margin structure at those shelf prices, so I can decide go or no-go. (Desk research, not shelf data: customs, logistics, retailer margin assumptions are outside the verifier.)

### 4.2 Journey (proposal)

1. Describe the product (category, pack size, target price idea, origin) and the target cities and store types in a "market entry brief" request.
2. Shelfie plans a field job: comparable products and competitor products to be photographed in N stores (extra task fields beyond the current pack; see open questions).
3. Workers return verified photos; the verifier extracts price, product and (new) shelf facts.
4. Desk research and analyst/LLM synthesis is added, with each claim tagged shelf-verified or desk-researched.
5. The customer reads the report and downloads the evidence appendix.

Example values are placeholders, not market claims.

**E2 Report outline** (what the brief contains; sections marked S come from shelf data, D from desk research)
1. Summary and caveats (what is verified, what is not).
2. Shelf price landscape (S): observed prices per product, store type and city, with count of observations, min, median, max, and photo evidence links.
3. Competitor map (S plus D): products found next to or instead of the exporter's category, brand, pack size, price per litre or kg, facings if captured.
4. Positioning and presentation (S, D): packaging, claims, placement (shelf height, adjacency), promotion tags seen in stores.
5. Price corridor and margin sketch (S plus D): scenarios based on observed shelf prices and sourced cost assumptions; assumptions listed.
6. Regulatory and logistics notes (D only; sourced, flagged unverified until checked).
7. Evidence appendix: ledger and tx links, observation table, method and limits (freshness proven, location not).

### 4.4 Endpoints

None exist for this flow. Proposed (not in contracts yet): `POST /api/briefs` (create brief and its field jobs), `GET /api/briefs/{id}`, `GET /api/briefs/{id}/report`, `GET /api/observations?...` (aggregated shelf observations). The existing `POST /api/jobs` with `packId: "shelf-check"` would be reused per store group.

## 5. Proposed customer routes and APIs, not in contracts yet

| Proposed | Purpose | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboard/new` | Customer creates a job | customer auth, payment link to escrow or invoice; contracts have only shell/admin `POST /api/jobs` |
| `/dashboard/jobs/:id` | Deep link to one job | none beyond existing GETs |
| `/dashboard/jobs/:id/report` | Printable report | `reportMd` rendering |
| `/dashboard/ledger` | Full-screen ledger | existing ledger endpoints |
| `/dashboard/entry-brief` | Exporter request and report | new endpoints in 4.4, extended pack (comparison products, extra extraction fields) |
| Customer login | Separate customers' data | auth model; contracts have none |
| Localisation switch | DE/EN/ES | message catalogue |

Rule: do not add any of these to the engine without updating `contracts.md` in the same commit (repo-layout section 3 and core contract rule).

## 6. MVP (Fri-Sat) vs roadmap

| Capability | MVP (hackathon) | Later |
|---|---|---|
| Worker app: list, claim, code, capture, result, payout link | Yes | Accounts, reputation, onboarding, push notifications |
| Worker i18n | English | German, Spanish |
| Customer dashboard: job progress, ledger, report view | Yes (stage layout) | Customer auth, job history, filters |
| Customer places order | Via Sokosumi and shell; operator demo button | In-app order form, payment |
| Per-store status with live updates | Yes (SSE plus polling) | Map view, notifications |
| Task dispatch | Feed to all workers in the city, first claim wins | Assignment by distance, reputation, push notifications |
| Out-of-stock observation | Yes (secondary action, separate gates, same payout) | Second-worker sampling, per-worker OOS ratio flag |
| Request input | Dropdowns from the catalogs, ids only | Self-service catalog growth |
| Report | Markdown table from pack | PDF, CSV, API export, branded |
| Market-entry brief for exporters | No | Yes, section 4 |
| Aggregated shelf price database | No | Yes (product-roadmap.md) |
| Location proof | Soft browser-geolocation: city at claim, geofence distance at capture (default 150 m); freshness by code; no proof | Store-owned QR codes |
| Photo source | Live camera only (`getUserMedia`); no gallery; LAN HTTP is read-only | Attested capture (platform attestation, native app) |
| Stores per job | One (N=1, K=1, ADR-16) | Several stores with K-of-N (product-roadmap.md section 4a) |
| Customer i18n | English | German, Spanish |

## 7. Open questions, decide Friday

1. Does the pitch mention the exporter persona at all (one slide line, roadmap) or stay with Katharina only?
2. Does the demo include a customer-facing "new job" form, or only the operator button (recommended: operator only; time budget of D)?
3. Does `GET /api/jobs/{id}` return `reportMd` or only the decision endpoint (C3)?
4. (Resolved by ADR-17.) The live cheat: aim the live camera at an old photo or printout of the tag (or shoot a wrong code); no upload path exists.
5. SSE for `GET /api/submissions/{id}` or polling only (polling is in contracts).
6. Localised worker messages: only English in MVP, confirm.
7. Reward and price display: show tADA only, never EUR equivalents (confirm with storyline units note).
8. For the exporter later: which extraction fields must the shelf pack add (competitor brand, price per unit, facings, promotion tag), and how do they affect gates G3 to G5 (not designed).
9. Does the worker app need an explicit privacy acknowledgement on first run (proposal: yes, one screen)?
10. Does the Sokosumi hire form support option/select fields in the Coworker input schema (*verify Friday*, A)?
11. Do CIP-30 wallets inject `window.cardano` in the venue phones' browsers (*verify Friday*, D)? Paste stays the default.
12. Geolocation accuracy indoors at the demo store and at the venue: is 150 m plus accuracy enough, or is a larger demo radius needed (*verify Friday*, C and D)?
