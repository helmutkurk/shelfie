# Agent skills by role

Claude Code discovers project skills under .claude/skills. Codex does not auto-load these files; read the linked SKILL.md by hand.

## External skills (optional)

The Masumi hackathon SKILL.md, masumi-skills, Cardano Dev Skills, and Sokosumi MCP may be read as documentation. Installing any of them requires the machine owner's security review first; on Helmut's machine, use SkillSpector. Never auto-install. See [the official prompt's tool rules](../../investigacion/cardano/official-agent-prompt.md#4-rules-when-we-use-this-prompt).
